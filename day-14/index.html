      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;
      console.log(team);
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      team[3] = "Lux";
      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const players2 = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
      console.log("players2", players2);
      // one way
      const team2 = players2.slice();

      console.log("players2", players2);
      if (1 === 1) {
        team2[3] = "Lux";
      }
      console.log("team2", team2);
      console.log("players2", players2);
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
